## How to Setup

If you already did use `mani`, you are ready to go. If not you need to create a `mani.yaml` using command `mani.init` in VSCode or using `mani init` in Shell. This commands let you select create a new mani.yaml.

You also should install [mani](https://github.com/alajmo/mani?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) in a global path to use all Features.

> mani can be used to backup your local git projects setup. I would recommend putting the file [in a `.dotfiles` repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).
