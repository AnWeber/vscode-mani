# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in mani, please report it by using [Security Advisories](https://github.com/AnWeber/vscode-mani/security/advisories)

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make mani safe for everyone.
